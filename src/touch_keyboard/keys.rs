//! The key table: what is on each row, and how much of its row each key takes.
//!
//! The keyboard is **flex**. The box the band is given decides the size of everything: a key is a
//! share of its row ([`Key::portion`]), a row is a quarter of the band's height, and the only
//! absolute numbers left are the gaps, the padding and the type — the repository's rule, fluid
//! boxes and absolute type. Nothing here is a measurement of a screen, so nothing here has to be
//! told one.
//!
//! The shares are the original's (`VirtualKeyboard::build_resizable`), normalised so a letter key is
//! [`KEY_PORTION`]: the keyboard crate the original shared cannot be reused — it was built from the
//! framework this repository used to have — but its layout *is* the specification, and its ratios are
//! what it was: `key_w * 1.6` for the mode key, the shift key filling the edge of its row, and the
//! same four rows, keys, colours and numeric mode as the iOS keyboard.
//!
//! One thing could not be ported faithfully. The original keyboard labels shift, backspace and
//! return with the baked icons `⇧ ⬆ ⌫ ↵`, and the input cursor with `█`. The iced font is a Chinese
//! and Latin subset (the Source Han Sans subset) and still has none of those five codepoints — it
//! does carry the arrows and `± × ÷` now — and iced has no icon font for them, so those keys carry
//! ASCII words (`shift`, `del`, `return`) and the cursor is painted as a block by whoever owns the
//! text (see `lib.rs`).
