//! The iOS on-screen keyboard: four rows of keys on the band at the bottom of the screen.
//!
//! The terminal types commands with it, the settings app types a Wi-Fi password with it, and
//! neither owns it: the key table is the layout of the keyboard the original had (see [`keys`]) and
//! the palette is its `theme.rs`. What each app keeps for itself is the state a keyboard writes
//! into — a [`String`] and a cursor — and its own message type.
//!
//! # It is flex: it fills the box it is given, in both axes
//!
//! Nothing is passed in and nothing is measured: a key is a share of its row, a row is a quarter of
//! the band, and the band is 100% of whatever box the caller puts it in. A caller that wants the
//! band to be 200 px tall says so on the layout — `container(band(..)).height(Length::Fixed(200.0))`
//! — because the height of a keyboard is a decision about the page, not about the keyboard.
//!
//! That is also why there is no size to hand it: a widget in iced cannot ask how big it will be (the
//! layout happens after `view`), so a keyboard that computed its keys from a number would have to be
//! *told* one — and would then draw the keyboard of whichever screen that number came from.
//!
//! # How an app uses it
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use pomelo_widgets::touch_keyboard::{self, KeyAction, KeyboardMode};
//!
//! // in `view`, at the bottom of the page, as tall as the design says:
//! container(touch_keyboard::band(self.mode, Message::Key))
//!     .height(Length::Fixed(216.0))
//! ```
//!
//! [`band`] hands back a [`KeyAction`] through the closure: `Char`, `Backspace`, `Space`, `Enter`
//! and `SwitchMode`. The keyboard does not decide what any of them mean — `SwitchMode` is the only
//! one the app has to act on *for* the keyboard, by storing the mode it names.
//!
//! # Why it is shared
//!
//! There were two copies of this geometry before (the terminal's `keys.rs` and the original
//! keyboard crate), and a password keyboard that is two pixels off the terminal's is the kind of
//! difference nobody reports and everybody notices. One table, drawn by both — which is what
//! [`pomelo_widgets`](crate) exists for: every widget two apps draw is a module of it.
